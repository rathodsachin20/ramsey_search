### Description:
This framework makes use of multiple cloud services to solve a large problem. We used this to find largest counter-example of Ramsey number for given size (7). Cloud services used include AWS, Azure, Eucalyptus, HTC Condor and XSEDE supercomputers.  
Server co-ordinates between clients and sends updated graph sizes to clients when any client finds a larger counter-example. Amazon's DynamoDB is the centralized database used.  
Different algorithms are run on different cloud infrastructures. These include genetic algorithm, randomized graph algorithms (flipping edges randomely), simulated annealing.
